We found the association for turned parts on our search for reliable market statistics.</br>
So we got in touch with Hermann Rumpel, member of the board, to evaluate our project. The project was classified as promissing but technical challenging.</br>
The company Rumpel Precision employs 70 employees and is OEM for automotive industry and other fields of mechanical engineering.</br>
The company bought an extra turning machine only for prototyping right now, wich is of special interest for Rapidfacture. We thank them for the feedback.
