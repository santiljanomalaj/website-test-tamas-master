A project competition in which craft businesses can submit promising digitization projects from their companies and win attractive prizes. "Bit’s don’t bite" is a joint initiative by the urban industrial development association IFG, the Chamber of Crafts and the Entrepreneurs Women. Since the end of 2017, they have been supporting the trades on the way to the digital future, providing impetus and helping companies to build a network.
