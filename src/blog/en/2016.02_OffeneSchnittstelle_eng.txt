Only a few software providers in mechanical engineering make their interfaces public.</br></br>
The reluctance of knowledge should lock customers in. This means in practice that a lack of compability leads to additional manual expense and transmission errors.</br>
The idea of a optimized and linked production based on the idea „industry 4.0“ is blocked.</br>
We belive that we can bind clients with good products and publish therefore our interfaces on GitHub.
We also belive that open interfaces and in particular open source are real enrichments. </br></br>

We ourself develop our technology using open source. Cooperation is effective and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.
