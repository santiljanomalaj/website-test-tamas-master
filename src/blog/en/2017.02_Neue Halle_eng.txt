[description]
The move into our new industrial hall has been successful. The machine was without electricity only for three days â€“ careful planning is half the battle.</br></br>

A conventional lathe was purchased for simpler tasks and professional deburring. Furthermore, we  have a small but fine office now. </br>
In our pallet rack we have plenty of space for material and other equipment.
It has become time...
We were surprised how many things have fit in the small garage before.
