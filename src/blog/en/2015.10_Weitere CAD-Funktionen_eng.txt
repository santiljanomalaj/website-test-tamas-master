![CAD 3D-view](../img/blog/cad3dView.png)


[description]
We started the work on user-accounts for the Online-CAD and improved the contour definition process.</br>
Single elements can be moved by drag and drop so the contour can be redefined easily.</br>
Furthermore we started with the implementation of a 3D-view, which can be tested in the right side bar of the CAD. </br></br>

We provide an export function for STL files. Transitional radius, chamfer and undercuts are new features under edge/surface view.
