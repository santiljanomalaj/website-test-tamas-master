We are on CeBit and the Hannover Messe for industrial technology as an exhibitor.</br></br>

Two years ago no manufacturing company was excited about our idea and doubts about the feasibility of the project occured.</br>
Now, tables have turned. Our system enjoys massive popularity on exhibitions. Many companies were interested in becoming manufacturing partners, others want to buy our software.</br></br>
We use this feedback for further product development, improve the concept and carry the software forward.
