[description]
A Traub TNA 300 with power of 22 kW is now our own and first orders were produced.</br>
The machine is used but precission is right â€“ tolerances of 0.01mm are no problem.</br></br>

Thanks to driven tools bore circles, cross holes, engravings or wrench sizes can be produced.</br>
The machine makes us independent from other production companies so the software can better tested and goods faster delivered.
