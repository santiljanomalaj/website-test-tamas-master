Finally more space! </br>
Following a short phase of renovation, our new representational office in Unterschlei√üheim is ready for occupancy at the beginning of July.</br>
Because of our steadily growing team it was necessary to move into a larger office to create more space for new talents and promote a work atmosphere that fosters creativity and innovation.</br></br>
There are three more rooms now and a big conference room.</br>
We are now enjoying the open space, new desks and a spacious kitchen for a cup of coffee or two :) .
