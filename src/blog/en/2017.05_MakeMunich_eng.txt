Make Munich in May was our first fair for private customers.</br></br>
We were promptly reminded of how difficult it was to obtain precision parts privately (one of the reasons why we founded Rapidfacture).</br>
Once again, we noted that trade fairs are good way to recruite new employees - we met our new factory student there.</br></br>
We redesigned our little demo machine to our Rapidfacture colours and manufactured little blue tokens for the game “Do not get angry, man” for fair visitors.</br>
Especially the little visitors enjoy it and commented: "Wow"
