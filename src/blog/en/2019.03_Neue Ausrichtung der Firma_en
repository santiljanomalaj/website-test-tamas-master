![A new direction](../img/blog/neue_ausrichtung.png)

[description]
Based on previous experience with low delivery reliability at manufacturing companies and due to the founders' personal interest in the processes of developing and selling as components, we decide to go further in the software direction. While online parts trading was our founding idea, the focus shifted to the technology itself because we saw the lack of digital tools as the biggest hurdle to our vision of the connected factory.</br></br>

And although we always doubted whether a further provider was needed for the next software solution, experience with everyday production has shown us that there is still a lot of potential. In particular, many solutions are not easy to use and difficult to network with other software. The integration costs are high. We imagine it differently.</br></br>

We ourselves believed that it made no sense to type the text from emails and that it had to be possible to calculate, plan and derive NC programs automatically. To solve such tasks is not easy. But it is not a question of feasibility. It's about getting started.
