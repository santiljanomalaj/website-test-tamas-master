[description]
From now on registered users can use our live price estimation.</br></br>

The pricing is quite under construction but already contains a lot of parameters like material costs, precision, radius elements, features, weight and stability (over all about 50 parameters).</br>
Optimizations regarding material, machine and process were taken into account for higher quantities.</br>

User-accounts, where drawings can be saved and orders are transparent were also added. Drawings can be shared upon request.</br></br>

Rapidfacture offers public CAD-templates to faciliate the introduction. The standard parts can be customized easily.
