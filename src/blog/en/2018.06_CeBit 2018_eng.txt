From June 11th to 15th, 2018, the CeBit fair took place in Hannover this year. And Rapidfacture was part of it. </br></br>
The concept of CeBit 2018 looks new: more business festival and less IT fair.
Innovation and digitization were paramount, with concerts, conferences and networking.</br></br>

The combination of business and emotions could be realized very well from us, by a presentation on the StartUp stage.
Joshua Simon, Rapidfacture's business development executive, has presented our company on Scale11, Europe's largest start-up platform, and talked to investors, decision-makers from big companies and creative minds.</br></br>


We are happy to announce that a platform like this is being offered to young companies. We are going to return again next year.
