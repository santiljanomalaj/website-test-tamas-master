[description]
The master thesis for our CAM-solution is submitted at University of Applied Sciences Nuremberg.</br>
Research about existing CAM-software in the beginning, lead to the new development of our own process optimized solution with our own CAD format.</br>
The concept was validated on a CNC-turning machine at a manufacuring parter.</br></br>

Special thanks to Prof. Dipl.-Ing. K.-D. Beier for his engaged supervision of the thesis.</br>
The impelementation, further development and adoption to products of software partners will be our challenge for the next months.</br>
For the upcoming testing and optimation of simple turning processes, as well as demonstration of process chain a used small CNC-turning machine will be bought.</br></br>

This will be funded with resources of EXIST founder scholarship.
