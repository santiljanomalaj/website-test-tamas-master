The development of CAM-processor proceeds.</br>
The feature based contour disassembling recognizes undercuts and grooves and selects tools automatically.</br>
Thread and grinding undercuts, grooves for locking rings can be proceeded in a standardized process.</br></br>

As next steps further processings will be integrated and radius compensation revised. Grooves with radius elements – for example required for pulleys – will become producible.
