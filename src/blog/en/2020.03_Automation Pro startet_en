With <a href="img/downloads/Automation_Pro.pdf">Automation Pro</a>, we want to deliver a practical, complete solution for manufacturing companies. We see ourselves as an intermediary between your company and the digital world.</br></br>

Updates. Software. Interfaces. Licenses. Didn't you want to manufacture components?
One must still be - Industry 4.0. Our favorite word. You shouldn't even notice that you are working with software. Software should be as precise and reliable as your production machines. After all, it's about manufacturing precision components.</br></br>

It is difficult for outsiders to understand how complex the rough everyday work of manufacturing is with all the necessary details. And woe it only happens a little mistake. In addition to the challenges of manufacturing, there are others that are significantly less fun: price war, a mountain of inquiries, late deliveries or finding good employees. Where else can you get them - through temporary employment agencies?</br></br>

In the long term, the digital champions are at the top just like in other industries, e.g. Trade or printing industry; other companies stop operating. It is positive that with higher automation there is hardly any competition with low-wage countries. In the area of ​​small lot sizes, autonomous production will set new standards: 50% more productivity, hardly any inquiry loops in the process, and assistance systems will support the difficult issues of production.
