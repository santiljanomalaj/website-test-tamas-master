"In March we showed our innovations at the CeBit again and in April at the Hannover Messe.</br></br>

While the interest was as great as in the previous year, we were proud to show new parts of our software we had made since than last year.</br>
In addition to company contacts, we have noted that there is at least one good potential employee at every fair.</br></br>

Now we can count the start-up "Konstruktiv Berlin" https://konstruktiv-berlin.de/kontakt/to to our circle of friends :-)"
