We met Paul Mayer and Falk Michel at mitgruender.com.</br>
Both have already worked on several projects.</br></br>
They bring personal qualities which were essential for start-ups: entrepreneurial spirit, inventsiveness, learning ability and humour.</br>
It is a big pleasure to include both into our team. Falk and Paul have a good sense for design an usability â€“ they will work on the frontend development.</br>
The picture was taken at our visit of Molding Expo 2015.</br></br>
