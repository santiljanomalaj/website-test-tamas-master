[description]
The structure of our Online-CAD was revised and an „undo“ function integrated.</br></br>
The second view „edges/faces“ was implemented. From now on inner contours can be defined. Circle elements were added. Threads, knurlings and surface quality features were added to the tab „edges/faces“.</br>
Furthermore a frame for system messages was integrated. Simple shafts, screws, connectors or bolts can be designed with the actual features.</br>
Features like bore circle or milling operations will come up next.
