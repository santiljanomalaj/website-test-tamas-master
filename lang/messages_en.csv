"recommendationThermocycling","We wanted to pour the standard manual for heating construction that we developed into software suitable for construction sites. Many software companies limit themselves to pure programming - without knowledge of the application. We received a complete package from Rapidfacture: software development combined with engineering services. Little need for communication and explanation; the respective software versions worked. <br> <br> Surprisingly, I had to take little care of the project - a sure-fire success."

"accuracyInfo","Mechanically functional parts, such as rotating shafts or joints, and especially parts that should fit together, require a high degree of accuracy. The theoretical nominal size cannot be achieved due to deviations in practice. The accuracy is one of the main cost factor in mechanical production. Dimensional accuracy is indicated by <a title=\"Wikipedia Toleranz\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance\">tolerances</a> &mdash; every measure has a tolerance. For high-precision applications, parts are prefilmed and then respharpened on circular grinding machines, with the precision in the range of single-digit thousandths of a millimeter."

"AGB_P_1.2","<b>(2)</b> Products offered by Rapidfacture are aimed equally at private and corporate customers. For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions, a private customer is any natural person to whom the purpose of the contract can not be attributed to any commercial or independent professional activity (ยง 13 BGB). A corporate customeris a natural or legal person or a legal partnership that acts in the execution of the contract in the exercise of their commercial or independent professional activity (ยง 14"
"AGB_P_1.3","<b>(3)</b> Terms and Conditions of the customer do not apply, even if we do not separately contradict their validity in individual cases."
"AGB_P_1.4","<b>(4)</b> In individual cases, individual agreements with the customer (including collateral agreements, additions, changes) have priority over these GTC. Such agreements shall be governed by a written contract or a written confirmation from Rapidfacture."

"AGB_P_10.2","<b>(2)</b> The customer is not entitled, without our prior written consent, to resell the goods subject to retention of title delivered by us."
"AGB_P_10.3","<b>(3)</b> The customer is authorized to process the goods subject to retention of title in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the following provisions:"
"AGB_P_10.4","(a) The retention of title extends to the full value of the products resulting from the processing, mixing or combination of our goods, whereby we are considered the manufacturer. If, during processing or connection with goods of third parties, their ownership rights remain, we acquire co-ownership in proportion of the invoice value of the processed or connected goods. The same applies to the resulting product as to the goods delivered under retention of title."
"AGB_P_10.5","(b) The customer hereby assigns to us the claims against third parties arising from the resale of the product in its entirety or in the amount of our possible co-ownership share, in accordance with the preceding paragraph. We accept the assignment."
"AGB_P_10.6","(c) To collect the claim, the customer remains authorized next to us. We undertake not to collect the claim as long as the customer meets his payment obligations to us, does not default in payment, no petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and no other lack of his efficiency exists. However, if this is the case, we can demand that the customer notify us of the assigned claims and their debtors, provide all information necessary for collection, hand over the associated documents and notify the debtors (third parties) of the assignment."
"AGB_P_11.1","<b>(1)</b> Rapidfacture guarantees the production of perfect goods according to manufacturing aspects. For this purpose technical details made in drawings such as dimensions and surface properties are decisive. The function of components in use can not be guaranteed because Rapidfacture neither knows the intended use nor is it involved in the design. For damaged or destroyed components (for example, too high forces, corrosion, continuous stress, wrong choice of material) is therefore not guaranteed."
"AGB_P_11.2","<b>(2)</b> The warranty period from delivery is two years for private customers, twelve months for business customers."

The decision will be made in writing (also by fax or e-mail) to the customer within three working days after notification of the defect. We can refuse the type of supplementary performance chosen by the customer"
"AGB_P_11.4","<b>(4)</b> If the supplementary performance fails or is unacceptable to the customer or Rapidfacture refuses subsequent performance, the customer is entitled in each case in accordance with applicable law, to withdraw from the contract, to reduce the purchase price or to claim damages or reimbursement of his futile expenses."
"AGB_P_11.5","<b>(5)</b> Technical data and material prices on our website are reference values, for the correctness of which no liability is assumed. The calculation software of the website serves as a help for rough layout. Rapidfacture does not guarantee the correctness of the results."

In the case of simple negligence, only for damages resulting from injury to life, limb or health as well as for damages resulting from the violation of a material contractual obligation. In this case, liability is limited to compensation for foreseeable, typically occurring damage. For damages from impossibility and delay Rapidfacture is liable for the violation of cardinal obligations."

"AGB_P_12.6","<b>(6)</b> In case of infringement of foreign property rights by a delivery item according to drawings, models, samples, developments or other information of the customer or using parts provided by the customer, the customer has to indemnify us from claims and to compensate the damages incurred as well as the necessary costs of legal defense as far as the customer is responsible for the breach of duty."
"AGB_P_13.1","<b>(1)</b> There is no right of withdrawal according to the statutory provisions (ยง312 g BGB), as all products distributed by us, including all products on our website, are individually manufactured to customer specifications, not prefabricated goods. However, if an order is not yet in production, an order may be canceled at the discretion of Rapidfacture. In this case we ask you to contact us immediately by phone."

"bernhardFelixStory1","Bernhard Rรถmer and Felix Furtmayr got to know each other during their mechanical engineering Bachelor at the <a href=\"http://www.thi.de/\" title=\"Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt\">TH Ingolstadt</a>. During their final thesis, they discovered that precision parts are often difficult to obtain for students and private customers. Because contract payers are reluctant to deal with little lucrative and elaborate individual pieces or with incomplecte drawings. The idea was to discribe CNC-manufactured parts on the internet, to facilitate access and to optimize the overall process. The two founders decided to do the project independently."
"bernhardFelixStory2","Gradually, a network of contacts was further investigated and the idea was concretized. With the support of the <a href=\"http://www.th-nuernberg.de/\" title=\"Technische Hochschule Nรผrnberg\">TH Nuremberg</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fau.de/\" title=\"Friedrich Alexander Universitรคt Erlangen-Nรผrnberg\">FAU Erlangen</a> , both founders devoted their master theses to the further elaboration of the project. In October 2014, the team was expanded by three programmers. An EXIST-founding scholarhip ensured the initial financing of the project. It started with a lathe in the own garage. Since 2017, a partner network has been set up so that the team could focus more and more on optimizing the process and software components."

"costEffective1","Accuracy causes costs. Set tolerances only as accurately as required for the function. Preicse parts must first be workd out roughly, measured and then finely processed."
"costEffective2","The diameter dimensions of many raw materials are often round dimensions such as 20, 60 or 80 mm. If possible, construct the largest diameter 1 mm smaller than the next round dimension &mdash; e.g. 119 instead of 120 mm. This means that the part can be produced with little effort from the raw material 120 mm."
"costEffective3","Large ratios of length to diameter cause effort &mdash; ideal are ratios under 4:1. Long thin waves turn through during machining, so the processing speed must be reduced.When machining internal contours, the tools turn away, resulting in loss of accuracy. With an intermediate storage (Lunette), even very long workspieces can still be rotated &mdash; we do not offer this option. However, drawn/ground shafts can be worked on at the ends with little effort."
"costEffective4","Among our standard materials, V2A, V4A and bronze are the most expensive. For individual parts under 50 mm, the material costs are often negligible, but rise strongly with the diameter."
"costEffective5","Aluminium  is the easiest to work with. The steels V2A and V4A are harder to process due to their high toughness, making the production more expensive. Technical plastics such as POM or PA are well-machinable, but bend easily away, which may require additional devices."
"costEffective6","Fine structures and thin wall thickness below 3 mm are hard to produce, for the workpiece bends easily. The expense to mount the workpiece and the tendency for vibration rises."

"faqStoredMaterials","Please view our list of in-stock materials on the <a href=\"turning.html#materials\" title=\"Table of in-stock materials\">Production info</a> page."
"faqSystemRequirements","A current version of your browser is required to use the online CAD. Because of the high programming effort, the CAD is not adapted for older versions of Internet Explorer (under version 10). Please update your browser, due to certain security vulnerabilities also in your self-interest, if necessary."
"faqTemplates","For a quick introduction to the CAD we recommend you to use one of our <a href=\"https://cad.rapidfacture.com/#/contour/templates\" title=\"CAD Standard Templates\">templates</a>. Maybe your required workpiece is already there, so only minor changes are needed."
"faqUnitPrices","The unit costs are strongly related to the number of pieces. There is an unavoidable, but only one time, cost per order for equipping the respective machine. If the unit price for a single part were to be 70 โฌ, five parts might only cost 150 โฌ. In case of higher quantities, it can also be further automated/optimized (bar loader, multi-spindle turning machine)."
"faqUploadingOwnData","Our Live Price works with turned parts. They can be uploaded as STEP file, importet and edited in the CAD. You may add Features and tolerances. Other drawind data can also be uploaded, but there will be no price estimation."
"faqWhoProducesParts","Since January 2016 we have our own production to ensure short delivery times and maximum quality. In the case of special requests, partner companies are at our side, which are exclusively German specialist companies."

"fitInfo","For precise diameter measurements, the fit system is often used to define the tolerance. The definition of fits is made by the <a title=\"Engineering fit on Wikipedia\" href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passung\">fit system</a>, which is always composed of two parameters: An indication of the position of the tolerance (above/below the nominal diameter) and the accuracy indication. For example, the fit &bdquo;H7&ldquo; indicates that it is a fit with the location &bdquo;H&ldquo; (= close to the nominal diameter) with accuracy &bdquo;7&ldquo;. H7 is the right fit for many ball bearings &mdash; hardly any game, but still pushable by hand. For fits, tolerance class 7 (e.g. fit H7) is standard for CNC turning. Tolerance class 6 can even be achieved. For higher accuracy, the parts have to be sharpened in addition round after turning."

"radiiInfo","Many <a title=\"Wendeschneidplatten auf Wikipedia\" href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendeschneidplatte\">inserts</a> have a radius of 0,4 mm. Therefore, inside corners of the rotated contour cannot be made sparp-edged. It is also more advantageous for stability, since sharp transistions weaken components. However, if radii are not allowed (because the part is to be screwed up to the stop and is obstructed by the radius), then a puncture must be applied. Balls, free stitches and small radii can be measured poorly. The tolerances of radii are still difficult to control. Here it is necessary to measure complex with coordinate measuring machines and these are accordingly expensive."

"surfaceInfo","Turning reaches very smooth surfaces. The surface finish is better than milling because the thickness is constant and the cutting process is more stable (lower vibration inclination). More information can be found in the <a title=\"Oberflรคchenrauheit & Oberflรคchenangaben โ Zeichnung\" href=\"http://www.precifast.de/oberflaechenrauheit-oberflaechenangabe-zeichnungen/\">CNC blog Precifast</a>."

"threeDCADModels","3D CAD models"
"tolerancesInfo","Always make sure, that exact dimensions (e.g. if the part has to fit into a counterpart) are given a sensible tolerance. All untolerated dimensions of a drawing fall under the <a title=\"Wikipedia Tabelle Allgemeintoleranz\" href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleranztabellen_nach_ISO_2768\">general tolerance</a>. This can be too coarse for many applications. For example, a bolt with a diameter of 32 mm receives a tolerance of ยฑ 0,3 mm. For high dimensional accuracy, we always produce tolerance center. A measurement with 50 mm and + 0,1 mm tolerance is therefore made to 50,05 mm ยฑ 0,05 mm."
"tolerancesInfoHeadline","Tolerances"
"turningMethodInfo","Turning, together with milling, is one of the most commonly used techniques in the field of metal cutting. Mainly metals, but also plastics are processed. When turning, the workpiece is rotated and the material is removed by means of a stationary tool. This creates a rotationally symmetrical component. Typical applications are tips, nozzles, faucets, but above all machine components from the drive technology such as bearings, shafts, spindles, gear-wheels, cylinders or pistons. Also flanges, as they are needed for attachhing electro motors or for joining pipes."
"turningMethodInfoHeadline","The process &bdquo;turning&ldquo;"
"undercutInfo","Turning tools have radii on the cutting edge, so that no sharp edges are created on the workpiec, but curves. If a counterpart is to be fitted precisely to the surfaces of the workpiece, these curves are disturbing because the counterpart is here. With a free-stitch, material is removed, so that a space is created. Free stitches are required due to production (discontinuation of the tool) or to ease assembly. Further information can be found in the <a title=\"CNC-Blog Precifast: Freistiche\" href=\"http://www.precifast.de/freistich-din-509-technisches-zeichnen/\">CNC-blog Precifast</a>."

In addition to the pure geometric tolerances, surface and machining (e.g. threads) are defined with, which makes automated processing possible. As a web application, the CAD is usable by any computer in the company network without installation."
"CAMSoftwareDescription","The RAPIDFACTURE CAM creates NC programs based on process, material and tool databases. The contour of the turned parts will automatically breaked down to define the needed tools and edits. The final export is a work and arm plan including the NC program. Instructions for measuring will be added to the NC program as comments. Independently of the large number of parameters, the software is easy to use."
"ERPSoftwareDescription","The RAPIDFACTURE ERP provides a shared administration and archivement of orders. Coupled with the accompanying drawing and the NC programs it eliminates the hassle of searching in the future.
Because of the modular design of the ERP system you could purchase only for your relevant components and integrate them into your system.
The web interface allows you to use the ERP from any computer in your corporate network without any installation."
"CALCSoftwareDescription","In comparison with other calculation tools or excel spreadsheets the RAPIDFACTURE CALCulator depends on more details. This allowes a more realistic calculation of arm and edit times. Instead of estimates all given details will be involved. The calculation still regards on the machine, tools and material parameters. Even people without many years of CNC experience can calculate prices and experienced people could increase their efficiency by comparing."
